This code is tricky, because it uses Acorn, a programming language that you don't know.

Acorn is a theorem proving language. Look at real.ac and nat.ac to get a sense of how it works.

You can run

```
acorn
```

to run the verifier. This should be run after every change, to make sure the proof is verifiable.
