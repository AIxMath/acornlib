This repository is a mathematics library, written in Acorn, building up mathematics from the
inherent axioms. The implementation of the Acorn language itself, the integrated AI, and the VS Code extension 
are handled in the [acorn repository](https://github.com/acornprover/acorn). The code for the acornprover.org website,
including documentation, is in the [acornprover.org repository](https://github.com/acornprover/acornprover.org).
